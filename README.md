# memoryGame

Memory in Motion is a take on the classic memory game built with jQuery. The player wins by matching all like user pairs before they run out of turns. This project strengthened my ability to manipulate the DOM and integrate third party JavaScript libraries like HandlebarsJS and MomentJS. Styles and animations were done with SCSS. The pixel art gifs used for the cards are by the exceedingly talented Glauber Kotaki at Counterplay Games.
